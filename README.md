## (M)jir ECS Library

Super cool ECS library in C!

Made for jirEngine, a 2D game engine

There are probably other better ECS, like flecs, but I wanted to make my own

## API Stuff
Public includes are in include, everything else is private (such as various files of utility functions)

### Naming
### Returns
0 is success while !0 indicates error, and the specific value is different per function
