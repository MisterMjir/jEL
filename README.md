Super cool ECS library in C!

Made for jIN, a game engine

There are probably other better ECS, like flecs, but I wanted to make my own

## Still a work in progress
There is a lot to come, a lot to improve, refine, and such.
Since there is some pretty cool stuff I'm making it public anyways.

It's not even version 0.0.0 yet

## Build and Install

```
$ cmake .
$ sudo make install
```
